# ChatGPDP

Chat with your favourite fictional characters!

This is a fake scenario and should not be taken seriously.

Change the initial prompt to change your fictional character's desired behavior.

If you're interested in chatting with your own PDF documents, check the [chatPDF](https://github.com/gabacode/chatPDF) project!

## General Notes

- Get a GPT API key from [OpenAI](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys) if you don't have one already.

- Set your API key and change the chat's colors from the top menu `Options -> Settings`.

- You can change your fictional character's desired behavior via the `Options -> Change Personality` menu.

- You can right click on a message to edit, or saving a new message to alter the course of your conversation.

- You can take a screenshot of your conversation via `Edit -> Take Screenshot`.

- Save and load conversations from the `File` menu.

- If you're encountering any issues, try starting a new conversation via the `File -> New Chat` menu.

- Ask any questions to your favourite fictional character!

- Enjoy!

## Why this project?

We shouldn't really need a reason to publish a project like this, but particular times call for particular measures.

GPDP stands for "Giving Power to Democratic Participation", it's a censorship-resistant (for now) way of accessing to OpenAI's [GPT-3.5 models](https://platform.openai.com/docs/models/gpt-3-5) while their GDPR compliance is being evaluated.

Also, being open source, means that you can understand and learn how to build a similar bot, giving you a degree of "freedom" in setting your initial prompt, to experiment with different bot personalities, and satisfying your curiosity.

Being an embedded and portable solution, means that you can share your conversations across different devices, and even with your friends.

Use this technology responsibly, and don't forget to have fun!

Peace.
